## Spectral Colors

The website is an interactive material for learning about spectrums of different instruments. It investigates the correlation of harmonic intensity and profile with loudness of produced sound.

Currently it's possible to listen to different registers of flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon, and observe the change of harmonic profile (the way how the harmonics and their intensities are structured) and their alternation due to the dynamic.

To look closer to the spectrum analysis you can choose one of the instrument clicking corresponding button on the top of the website.

The sounds of [British Philharmonia](https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/) were used for analysis. The spectrograms were done with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) by [Ilia Viazov](https://iliaviazov.github.io/CV/).
