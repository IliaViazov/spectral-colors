## Spectral Colors

The website is an interactive material for learning about harmonical spectrum of different instruments corresponding to the loudness of the sound.

Currently it's possible to listen to different registers of flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon.

The sounds of [British Philharmonia](https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/) were analysed with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) to produce these spectrograms by [Ilia Viazov](https://iliaviazov.github.io/CV/).
